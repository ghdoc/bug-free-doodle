	- [Backtracking](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/recursion-ii/472/backtracking/)  
	    Whenever you have a problem where you need to **generate all combinations/permutations of some group of letters/numbers**, the first thought you should have is backtracking. 

- BFS Breadth First Search
	
	- Use [Queue](https://workflowy.com/#/bada211e139e) to find shortest path between two nodes and use BFS for it.
